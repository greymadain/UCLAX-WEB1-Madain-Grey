# System Setup: Uclax Web 1

## Foundational course resources

We will use this during our first session to set up your:

-   Computer
-   Final project folder

### Suggestions:

-   Links within these instructions will replace existing page. This can get confusing, so we reccommend right + clicking on links to open in new tabs/windows so you do not lose your place'
-   Call course Leadership into your Zoom breakout room for assistance
    -   If something is unclear
    -   If something is taking more than 5-10 minutes to respond. Setup scripts in your terminal may take some time with no progress bar or little feedback. Often times, you just need to keep waiting for it to complete.
